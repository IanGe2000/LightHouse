## Initiation
This project is now based on Raspberry. We want to make an object tracking car system that tracks the displacement of the user by constantly moving itself to maintain constant distance from the object. Along with this function, we could also add in functions such as obstacles-avoiding and IR-locating.

## Latest Update
Maybe we can change Tensorflow API but we have no time to do that.  
Hope someone can help us to continue this project.  

## History Update

[2020-05-01]Hardware kit at hand now. Running some basic tests and trying to get into actual work now.  
[2020-04-03]Diving into the readings. Building up some basic concepts, fundamental details and implementations about this thing we're gona make.
