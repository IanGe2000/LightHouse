## Initiation
This project is now based on Raspberry. We want to make an object tracking car system that tracks the displacement of the user by constantly moving itself to maintain constant distance from the object. Along with this function, we could also add in functions such as obstacles-avoiding and IR-locating.

## Latest Update
Now the car can following a person more stably, but still has some params to adjust.
